# GlobalPositioningSystem

### What is GlobalPositioningSystem
GlobalPositioningSystem is a LSPosed module which works on rooted devices. I have been testing this with magisk + zygisk devices with LSPosed Module only.

### Known Issues ⚠️
1. Favorite locations are not persisting after sometime.
2. Main feature of the module isn't working 

Any reasonable PRs are welcome :)
